    - Built this site to own my portfolio, control design, and learn production web tooling.
    - Middleman stack with ERB templates, shared CSS, and YAML data for DRY content.
    - Open-sourced on GitHub and published via GitHub Pages for a fast, public site.   # 或改为：Open-sourced on GitHub and preparing GitHub Pages deployment to make the site public.
    - Resolved sticky/width glitches with CSS Grid minmax(0,1fr/3fr) and a CSS-only sidebar toggle.
    - Unified card UI, resume PDF download, accessible headings/links; updates are one-line YAML edits.

  subtitle: CIS Reserch Project   
  time: September 2024 - April 2025                                                                                                  
  description:
    - Built adversarial pipeline in Python/PyTorch/OpenCV to apply noise and rotation distortions.
    - Performed 500 + FGSM attacks (ε 0.02) on ResNet-18 to benchmark model robustness.
    - Automated end-to-end workflow delivering batch inference under 1 min with structured CSV logging.
    - Noise cut Top-1 accuracy 15% and combined attacks caused 85% errors; proposed defenses.
